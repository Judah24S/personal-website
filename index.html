            <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>
              I am deeply involved in exploring and working with cutting-edge
              technologies that not only solve everyday problems but also tackle
              bigger challenges with the potential to change lives. My passion
              lies in using innovative solutions to create meaningful, impactful
              changes in the world. Whether it's developing software to automate
              mundane tasks or building systems that empower individuals and
              businesses, I am committed to leveraging technology for progress
              and transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every day, I explore new technologies to streamline processes,
              enhance user experiences, and drive efficiency. From artificial
              intelligence to embedded systems, I embrace the full spectrum of
              technological innovation. My approach combines technical expertise
              with a deep understanding of human needs, ensuring that the
              solutions I create make a real difference in people's lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that technology is more than just a tool â€“ it's a
              catalyst for positive change. This belief drives me to
              continuously learn, experiment, and push the boundaries of what's
              possible, always with the goal of creating solutions that matter.

          <div id="martial-arts-content" class="hobby-detail">
            <h3>Martial Arts</h3>
            <p>
              My martial arts journey began with Krav Maga, where I learned
              practical self-defense techniques focused on real-world
              situations. This foundation in Krav Maga helped me develop
              discipline, mental resilience, and strategic thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seeking further growth, I transitioned to Kyokushin, a style
              renowned for its rigorous training and emphasis on toughness.
              Here, I learned not only how to push my limits physically but also
              how to cultivate inner strength and focus in the face of
              adversity.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion for martial arts led me to train under the legendary
              Ray Longo, whose expertise in mixed martial arts has had a
              profound impact on my approach to both training and life. His
              teachings have broadened my understanding of the sport, helping me
              integrate striking and grappling techniques effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              To deepen my knowledge and further expand my skillset, I spent a
              solid amount of time in Thailand, training under former and
              current Muay Thai champions. This experience provided me with
              invaluable insights into one of the most effective striking arts
              in the world, shaping my approach to martial arts as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through all of these experiences, martial arts has not only
              enhanced my physical capabilities but has also shaped my mindset,
              emphasizing perseverance, focus, and the drive for continuous
              improvement. It continues to influence my approach to
              problem-solving, both in and outside of the dojo.

            <h3>Travel</h3>
            <p>
              My travels have taken me to numerous countries, each offering
              unique experiences and opportunities for growth. I've had the
              privilege of living and staying in a couple of these countries for
              extended periods, which has allowed me to immerse myself in
              diverse cultures and philosophies.
            </p>
            <p>
              These extended stays have not only broadened my understanding of
              the world but also deepened my appreciation for the richness of
              human experiences across different cultures. From learning new
              languages to participating in local customs, each place has
              contributed to shaping my perspective in profound ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through my travels, I've been exposed to various ways of thinking,
              working, and living, which have had a significant impact on how I
              approach both my personal and professional life. The philosophies
              I've encountered have taught me valuable lessons in adaptability,
              empathy, and the importance of understanding different worldviews.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether exploring the bustling streets of vibrant cities or
              finding peace in quieter, more remote areas, my travel experiences
              have continuously fueled my curiosity and inspired my creative
              process. Each journey has played an integral role in shaping the
              way I approach challenges and opportunities in my work.
